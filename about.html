<p>Things about me: I started teaching myself HTML & CSS about a 15 years ago so that I could make my blogs pretty. Then I decided to major in Fashion Design, so it remained a passionate hobby. Then...tragically I realized I had just gone through 4 years of fashion school only to not even remotely want to work in the fashion industry. Que a 5 year existential crisis that I am no longer ashamed of. Long story very short I decided to turn my passion hobby into a career, and here I am.</p>
